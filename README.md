# ezDV

This repository contains both the hardware and firmware for a portable battery-powered device that can
(de)modulate [FreeDV](https://freedv.org/) from an attached radio. The board is centered around the 
following components:

* [Espressif ESP32-S3](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s3_datasheet_en.pdf)
* [TLV320 digital audio codec chip](https://www.ti.com/cn/lit/ds/symlink/tlv320aic3254.pdf?ts=1651153824042) produced by Texas Instruments ([application notes](https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slaa408a/slaa408a.pdf?ts=1651208477772&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F)).

## User's guide

See [here](https://tmiw.github.io/ezDV/) for the latest copy of the user manual for ezDV, which describes its
general use and operation.

## Building the firmware

Install [ESP-IDF v5.3](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.3/esp32s3/get-started/index.html) and then run the following:

```
. /path/to/esp-idf/export.sh
git submodule update --init --checkout --recursive
cd firmware
idf.py build
```
## Flashing the firmware

### Using ESP-IDF

Turn on ezDV (see below) and plug it into your computer's USB port, then run the following:

```
idf.py -p /dev/ttyxxx0 flash monitor
```

Where `/dev/ttyxxx0` (or `COMx:` on Windows) is the serial port created by your operating system after plugging ezDV in.

### Using ESP Flash Tool

On Windows, you can use the ESP Flash Tool to flash ezDV. This does not require installation of ESP-IDF.

1. Download the ESP Flash Tool from https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools.
2. Decompress all of the files in the ZIP file and execute flash\_download\_tool\_3.9.3.exe.
3. Select "ESP32-S3" for "ChipType", "Develop" for "WorkMode" and "USB" for "LoadMode" as shown below:

4. Add rows for each of the .bin files in the resulting screen:

| File Name | Offset |
|---|---|
| bootloader.bin | 0x0 |
| partition-table.bin | 0x8000 |
| ota\_data\_initial.bin | 0xF000 |
| ezdv.bin | 0x20000 |
| http_0.bin | 0x7F8000 |

Additionally, check each of the checkboxes to the left of the file name. It should look something like this, with each of the rows having a green background:

5. Set "SPI SPEED" to "80 MHz" and "SPI MODE" to "DIO".

6. Plug ezDV into your computer using a USB-C cable and turn it on by holding down the Mode button for a few seconds. Device Manager should show a new COM port named "USB/JTAG serial debug unit" or similar. Enter this COM port into the "COM" field in the application.

7. (Optional) Push the ERASE button. This will show a green "SYNC" indicator for a bit followed by "Download" and then "FINISH" as per the above screenshot. *Note: There will be no firmware installed on the board once this step finishes. You will need to reconfigure ezDV after new firmware has been flashed.*

8. Push the START button. This will go through the same indicators as step 1 but this time will also have a progress bar indicating how far it's gotten in flashing the new software. 

9. Push the STOP button and then close the application. Open the ezDV enclosure and briefly push/release the "Reset" button on the right hand side of the board. If everything went well, you'll see the four LEDs light up for a few seconds indicating that ezDV is booting normally.

### Using esptool

You can also use [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool). For example:

```
esptool esp32s3 -p /dev/cu.usbmodem14101 -b 460800 --before=default_reset --after=hard_reset write_flash --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 80m --flash_size detect 0x0 bootloader.bin 0x20000 ezdv.bin 0x8000 partition_table/partition-table.bin 0xf000 ota_data_initial.bin 0x7f8000 http_0.bin
```

### Recovering from a bad flash

If the flash process fails (or you are flashing for the first time), you can manually place ezDV into flash mode by holding down the "GPIO0/Flash" button while pushing the "Reset" button on the board. Hold "GPIO0/Flash" for a second or so after releasing Reset, then release. You can then use ESP-IDF, the ESP Flash Tool or esptool to flash ezDV with working firmware.
