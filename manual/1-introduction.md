# Introduction

ezDV is a handheld hardware device that allows easy use of [FreeDV](https://freedv.org), whether on the go or at home. 
Powered by an ESP32-S3 microcontroller, its built-in Wi-Fi support allows completely wireless setup (with supported radios) 
along with enabling more modern functionality such as FreeDV Reporter reporting and wireless firmware updates.

For those radios without network capability, interfacing them with ezDV is straightforward through the use of the industry 
standard 3.5mm TRRS audio jack. This jack is configured similarly to what is used with wired headsets for mobile phones. 
Analog audio is also passed in and out from/to your wired headset using a second 3.5mm audio jack.

This document describes the configuration and recommended usage of the ezDV device for maximum enjoyment and minimal
frustration. Hope to hear you on the air!
