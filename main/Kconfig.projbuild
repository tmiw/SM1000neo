config EZDV_ENABLE_TICK_OUTPUT
    bool "Enable per-tick debugging"
    default n
    help
        Enables the printing of periodic debugging output.  This output comes 
        from the main application task (Application.cpp) and can consist of 
        one or more types of debugging output that prints every X milliseconds.

        NOTE: this output may impact the performance of executing tasks (especially 
        anything network-related).

config EZDV_TICK_OUTPUT_INTERVAL
    int "Debugging output interval (ms)"
    default 5000
    depends on EZDV_ENABLE_TICK_OUTPUT
    help
        How often to output debugging data to the console in milliseconds.

config EZDV_PRINT_HEAP_USAGE
    bool "Print heap usage"
    default n
    depends on EZDV_ENABLE_TICK_OUTPUT
    help
        Outputs the amount of heap remaining in bytes organized by the
        following categories:
        * 8 bit allocations
        * 32 bit allocations
        * Difference between 32 and 8 bit allocations
        * Internal RAM
        * SPIRAM
        * DMA capable RAM

config EZDV_ENABLE_TX_RX_AUTOMATED_TEST
    bool "Enable TX/RX toggling"
    default n
    depends on EZDV_ENABLE_TICK_OUTPUT
    help
        Performs a stress test of the main ezDV code by toggling TX
        and RX every tick interval. This will also attempt to reset
        the active FreeDV mode to 700D.

config EZDV_OUTPUT_TASK_LIST
    bool "Print FreeRTOS task list"
    default n
    depends on EZDV_ENABLE_TICK_OUTPUT
    select FREERTOS_USE_TRACE_FACILITY
    select FREERTOS_GENERATE_RUN_TIME_STATS
    select FREERTOS_VTASKLIST_INCLUDE_COREID
    help
        Prints a list of executing FreeRTOS tasks.

        NOTE: FreeRTOS tracing options will need to be double-checked after disabling this
        option as they are forced on even after disabling.

config EZDV_DUMP_TIMERS
    bool "Print timers"
    default n
    depends on EZDV_ENABLE_TICK_OUTPUT
    help
        Prints timer statistics to the console.
